# Landing-Page
First Odin project: a landing page

This will be my first project. After finishing this project I will reflex here on what I have learned, things I needed a refresher on, etc.

This was a very smooth project. It took me a few hours to complete and used Google here and there but I think I have mastered flexbox pretty well. I had a little confusion about putting the image aboe text using flexbox but I figured it out by looking at css-exercises problem #4. Will reference design in the future for use maybe!
